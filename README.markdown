This project is a minimal example of how to integrate with the [roar engine](roarengine.com)
for online game development.

You'll need to do a few things to make it work.

1. Create a free account with [roar engine](roarengine.com) and create a game.
An empty game will suffice at this stage, you can always tweak parameters and
add content later.

2. Host xhr_jsonp.php somewhere online. (This will not be needed once the roar
engine has official support for this access method)

3. Edit the roar_minimal.html so that my_xhr_address and my_game_name are correct.

You should now be able to login and use the engine from this page
